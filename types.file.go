Each file object contains the following keys. In addition, it must contain a key corresponding with the value of type. The value is an object containing type-specific configuration. The type-specific configurations are described in the sections below.

Externally hosted files vs. Files hosted by Notion
For files and URLs hosted outside of Notion, we support retrieving the link as well as updating it to a different link. We don't currently support uploading files to Notion through the API, however, for files already uploaded to Notion, we support retrieving the file URL. The table below details what's supported for Embed, Image, Video, Audio, and File blocks, as well as page icon and page cover image properties.
